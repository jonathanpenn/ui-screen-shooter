Chooses a device type from the iPhone Simulator using menu
selection events.

To use, make sure this file is executable, then run from the terminal:

  bin/choose_sim_device "iPad (Retina)"

Originally, I tried to do this by editing the Preference file for the
simulator, and it worked under Xcode 4.3, but now it ignores those changes
often enough that I chose to use this menu-selection route.
