# unix_instruments
#
# A wrapper around `instruments` that returns a proper unix status code
# depending on whether the run failed or not. Alas, Apple's instruments tool
# doesn't care about unix status codes, so I must grep for the "Fail:" string
# and figure it out myself. As long as the command doesn't output that string
# anywhere else inside it, then it should work.
#
# I use a tee pipe to capture the output and deliver it to stdout

  # piped to another process, we have to use ptys to get around that so that we
  # can use `tee` to save the output for grepping and print to stdout in real
  # time at the same time.

  # I don't like this because I'm hard coding a tty/pty pair in here. Suggestions
  # to make this cleaner?
